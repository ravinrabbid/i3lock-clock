2013-06-09 i3lock 2.5

 • NEW DEPENDENCY: Use libxkbcommon for input handling
   This makes input handling much better for many edge cases.
 • Bugfix: fix argument parsing on ARM (s/char/int/)
 • Bugfix: free(reply) to avoid memory leak
 • Bugfix: Use ev_loop_fork after fork, fixes forking on kqueue based OSes
 • Bugfix: Fix centering the indicator in the no-xinerama case
 • Only use mlock() on Linux, FreeBSD (for example) requires root
 • promote the "could not load image" message from debug to normal
 • s/pam_message/pam_response/ (Thanks Tucos)
 • remove support for NOLIBCAIRO, cairo-xcb is widespread by now
 • Allow XKB_KEY_XF86ScreenSaver as synonym for enter
   This keysym is generated on convertible tablets by pressing a hardware
   lock/unlock button.
 • Allow passwordless PAM conversations (e.g. fingerprint)
 • Add ctrl+u password reset
 • Set window name to i3lock

    hardcoding a depth of 24

2011-11-06 i3lock 2.2

  • Don’t re-grab pointer/keyboard on MappingNotify. In some rare situations,
    this lead to some keypresses "slipping through" to the last focused window.
  • Correctly handle Mode_switch/ISO_Level3_Shift
  • Render to a pixmap which is used as background for the window instead of
    copying contents on every expose event
  • Handle screen resolution changes while screen is locked
